## Problem Statement
In today's world, understanding the nutritional value of food and managing medications effectively are critical yet challenging tasks. Consumers face several challenges:

- **Information Overload:** Nutrition labels and medicine details are difficult to interpret.

- **Lack of Personalization:** Most apps don’t account for dietary needs, allergies, or medication schedules.

- **Fragmented Knowledge:** No single source provides comprehensive food/medicine analysis.

- **Limited Tracking:** Food journals and pill trackers lack insights and timely reminders.

- **Health Impact Uncertainty:** People struggle to understand long-term effects of their choices.

## Our Solution combines FoodBar (nutrition AI) and MediScan (medicine tracker) into one powerful health assistant.
